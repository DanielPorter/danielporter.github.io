        <h2>Experience</h2>

        <h3>NASA Urban Air Mobility Internship - Summer 2024</h3>
        <p>
            During this internship at the Ames Research Center, I engaged in research focused on Urban Air Mobility (UAM). The project aimed to identify highways in the skies for UAM by leveraging clustering methods, along with additional environmental and metadata. The goal was to study small piloted air vehicles operating in urban areas as early proxies for future UAM traffic. The research aimed to identify corridors already in daily operation and analyze their properties, contributing to the development of safety guidelines and policies for the emerging field of Urban Air Mobility.
