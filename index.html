        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an undergraduate third-year transfer student at the <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, pursuing a four-year Bachelor of Arts with majors in "Statistics & Data Science" and "Mathematics". Academically, my interests include Bayesian Data Analysis, Statistical Learning Theory, and Applied Intelligent Systems research. 
            <br>
            Outside of academics, I enjoy being an amateur astronomer and reading high fantasy novels.

        <h3><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/armd/aosp/amp/" target="_blank">NASA Urban Air Mobility Internship - Summer 2024</a></h3>
        <p>
            The goal of this project was to study small piloted air vehicles operating in urban areas as early proxies for future Urban Air Mobility (UAM) traffic. The research aimed to identify corridors already in daily operation and analyze their properties, contributing to the development of safety guidelines and policies for the emerging field of Urban Air Mobility.
